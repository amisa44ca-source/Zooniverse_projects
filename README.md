# Zooniverse_projects_Portfolio
This repository contains documentation and analysis of my volunteer work on Zooniverse citizen science projects. Each folder corresponds to a specific project and includes:

- **Raw Data** (Google Sheets / CSV files)
- **Project Summaries** (Google Docs reports)
- **Charts & Visualizations** showing observations and trends
##Notes
- All work reflects careful observation, efforts, data recording and analysis.
- No assumptions has been made; only identifiable objects/ creatures were recorded.
- Charts use pastel color schemes for visual clarity and readability.
